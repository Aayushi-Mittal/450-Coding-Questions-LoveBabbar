## Day-5 How Internet Works - Server Side of World
> web server‘s fundamental job is to accept and fulfill requests from clients for static content from a website (HTML pages, files, images, video, and so on) while an application server provide its clients with access to what is commonly called business logic, which generates dynamic content. An application server’s clients are often applications themselves, and can include web servers and other application servers.

## Day-9 2 Pointers
The two pointer approach involves the use of multiple pointers.  We use these multiple pointers to keep track of multiple indices of our input. This is useful because it allows us to look at the values of two different indices at the same time. We can then make a decision based on the two values.
In order to use two pointers, most times the data structure needs to be ordered in some way, and decrease the time complexity from O(n2) or O(n3) of two/three nested for/while loops to O(n)of just one loop with two pointers and search each item just one time. In some cases, the time complexity is highly dependable on the data and the criteria we set.
Two pointer problems are not always as straight forward as they look. There are, however some ways through which we can identify whether a questions can be solved via 2 pointer approach or not -
- if input is sequences or sorted.
- need to make swap between indices.
- Partition of Array
- When you need to compare values at two different indices.
2 Pointers are mostly application in case of linear data structures only. We have discussed 3 types of data structures Arrays, Linked Lists and strings.
- Arrays
	- Constraint Based Problems
	- Frequency Analysis
	- Application on sorted Arrays
- Strings
	- Text and Pattern
	- Frequency Analysis
- Linked List
	- Removing nth element
	- Cycle Detection
	- Rotate a certain portion of a LL

## Day-10 
There 3 types of patterns which we apply in 3 pointer problems. 
- Index Based Technique
- Slow-fast Pointer technique
- Window based technique
There are different ways to put these techniques:
- Equi-directional: Both start from the beginning (slow-fast pointer,sliding window algorithm)
- Opposite-directional: One at the start and the other at the end, they move close to each other and meet in the middle (Index Based technique)
