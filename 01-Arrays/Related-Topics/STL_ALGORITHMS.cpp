// sort(first_iterator, last_iterator) – To sort the given vector.
// reverse(first_iterator, last_iterator) – To reverse a vector.
// *max_element (first_iterator, last_iterator) – To find the maximum element of a vector.
// *min_element (first_iterator, last_iterator) – To find the minimum element of a vector.
// accumulate(first_iterator, last_iterator, initial value of sum) – Does the summation of vector elements
// binary_search(first_iterator, last_iterator, x) – Tests whether x exists in sorted vector or not.
// lower_bound(first_iterator, last_iterator, x) – returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the range [first,last) which         has a value not less than ‘x’.
// upper_bound(first_iterator, last_iterator, x) – returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the range [first,last)                  which has a value greater than ‘x’.
